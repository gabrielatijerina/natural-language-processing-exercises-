    "- `Command + option + i` brings up the element inspector\n",
    "- We can also right click an element and select `inspect` in order to see an element's HTML\n",
    "- Inside of the element inspector, we can right click, copy, then `copy selector` to get the CSS selector\n",
    "- CSS selector(s) work  like a magic lasso for gettin your hands on a specific element or set of elements\n",
    "- CSS selectors and their usage https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors\n",
    "- Adding `view-source:` immediately before the URL in your browser allows you to see the text of `response.text`\n",
    "- Infinite scrolling content involves loading additional content after the first page load, making things more challenging to scrape\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Selectors\n",
    "- To find elements with the class=\"link\", `<a href=\"codeup.com\" class=\"link\">Codeup.com</a>`, we use:\n",
    "    - If you're using soup.find, you can use \"_class=link\" in your arguments\n",
    "    - If we use soup.select, we can put `.link` in soup.select(\".link\")\n",
    "- Some other CSS selectors to use with .select:\n",
    "    - .class_name\n",
    "    - #id_name, and IDs are unique to a page\n",
    "    - tag selectors. If we do `soup.select(\"a\")`, we'll get back a list of all the anchor tags\n",
    "\n",
    "- main, header, footer, section, article, div are generic containers for content. These are boxes of content\n",
